# ATM PIN Obfuscator

This Python project demonstrates a custom encryption and decryption mechanism for 4-digit ATM PIN codes using bitwise operations and encoding schemes. Developed as a data privacy concept.

## Features
- Encrypts 4-digit PIN using bitwise manipulation
- Decrypts to original form safely
- Demonstrates real-world use of lightweight cryptographic logic

## Use Case
Useful for local PIN storage in obfuscated form, with simple Python decryption on demand.
